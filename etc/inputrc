set bell-style none
#      Controls what happens when readline wants  to  ring  the
#      terminal bell.  If set to none, readline never rings the
#      bell.  If set to visible, readline uses a  visible  bell
#      if  one  is  available.   If  set  to  audible, readline
#      attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
set bind-tty-special-chars On
#      If set to On, readline  attempts  to  bind  the  control
#      characters  treated  specially  by the kernel's terminal
#      driver to their readline equivalents.
set blink-matching-paren On
        # If set to On, readline attempts to briefly move the cur‐
        # sor to an opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis
        # is inserted.
set colored-completion-prefix On
        # If set to On, when listing  completions,  readline  dis‐
        # plays  the  common prefix of the set of possible comple‐
        # tions using a different color.   The  color  definitions
        # are  taken  from  the value of the LS_COLORS environment
        # variable.
set colored-stats On
#      If set to On,  readline  displays  possible  completions
#      using different colors to indicate their file type.  The
#      color definitions  are  taken  from  the  value  of  the
#      LS_COLORS environment variable.
set comment-begin '#'
#      The   string   that   is   inserted  when  the  readline
#      insert-comment command is  executed.   This  command  is
#      bound to M-# in emacs mode and to # in vi command mode.
set completion-display-width 0
#      The  number  of  screen columns used to display possible
#      matches  when  performing  completion.   The  value   is
#      ignored  if it is less than 0 or greater than the termi‐
#      nal screen width.  A value of 0 will cause matches to be
#      displayed one per line.  The default value is -1.
set completion-ignore-case Off
#      If  set  to  On, readline performs filename matching and
#      completion in a case-insensitive fashion.
set completion-map-case Off
#      If set to On,  and  completion-ignore-case  is  enabled,
#      readline  treats  hyphens  (-)  and  underscores  (_) as
#      equivalent  when  performing  case-insensitive  filename
#      matching and completion.
set completion-prefix-display-length 0
#      The length in characters of the common prefix of a  list
#      of  possible completions that is displayed without modi‐
#      fication.  When set to a value greater than zero, common
#      prefixes  longer  than  this  value are replaced with an
#      ellipsis when displaying possible completions.
set completion-query-items 0
#      This determines when the user is queried  about  viewing
#      the number of possible completions generated by the pos‐
#      sible-completions command.  It may be set to any integer
#      value  greater  than or equal to zero.  If the number of
#      possible completions is greater than  or  equal  to  the
#      value of this variable, the user is asked whether or not
#      he wishes to view them; otherwise they are simply listed
#      on the terminal.
set convert-meta On
#      If  set to On, readline will convert characters with the
#      eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the
#      eighth bit and prefixing an escape character (in effect,
#      using escape as the meta prefix).
set disable-completion Off
#      If set to On, readline  will  inhibit  word  completion.
#      Completion  characters will be inserted into the line as
#      if they had been mapped to self-insert.
set editing-mode emacs
#      Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bind‐
#      ings similar to Emacs or vi.  editing-mode can be set to
#      either emacs or vi.
set echo-control-characters On
#      When set to On, on operating systems that indicate  they
#      support it, readline echoes a character corresponding to
#      a signal generated from the keyboard.
set enable-bracketed-paste On
        # When  set to On, readline will configure the terminal in
        # a way that will enable it to insert each paste into  the
        # editing buffer as a single string of characters, instead
        # of treating each character as if it had been  read  from
        # the  keyboard.   This can prevent pasted characters from
        # being interpreted as editing commands.
set enable-keypad Off
#      When set to On, readline will try to enable the applica‐
#      tion  keypad  when it is called.  Some systems need this
#      to enable the arrow keys.
set enable-meta-key On
#      When set to On, readline will try  to  enable  any  meta
#      modifier  key  the terminal claims to support when it is
#      called.  On many terminals, the meta key is used to send
#      eight-bit characters.
set expand-tilde On
#      If set to On, tilde expansion is performed when readline
#      attempts word completion.
set history-preserve-point Off
#      If set to On, the history code attempts to  place  point
#      at the same location on each history line retrieved with
#      previous-history or next-history.
set history-size -1
#      Set the maximum number of history entries saved  in  the
#      history  list.   If  set  to  zero, any existing history
#      entries are deleted and no new entries  are  saved.   If
#      set  to  a  value  less than zero, the number of history
#      entries is not limited.  By default, the number of  his‐
#      tory entries is not limited.
set horizontal-scroll-mode Off
#      When  set  to  On,  makes readline use a single line for
#      display, scrolling the input horizontally  on  a  single
#      screen line when it becomes longer than the screen width
#      rather than wrapping to a new line.
set input-meta On
#      If set to On, readline will enable eight-bit input (that
#      is,  it  will not strip the high bit from the characters
#      it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it can
#      support.  The name meta-flag is a synonym for this vari‐
#      able.
#isearch-terminators (``C-[C-J'')
#      The string of characters that should terminate an incre‐
#      mental search without subsequently executing the charac‐
#      ter as a command.  If this variable has not been given a
#      value,  the  characters  ESC  and  C-J will terminate an
#      incremental search.
set keymap emacs
#      Set the current  readline  keymap.   The  set  of  valid
#      keymap   names  is  emacs,  emacs-standard,  emacs-meta,
#      emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-command, and vi-insert.  vi is equiv‐
#      alent  to vi-command; emacs is equivalent to emacs-stan‐
#      dard.  The default value is emacs; the  value  of  edit‐
#      ing-mode also affects the default keymap.
#
set emacs-mode-string ""
        # This  string  is  displayed  immediately before the last
        # line of the primary prompt when emacs  editing  mode  is
        # active.   The  value  is expanded like a key binding, so
        # the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and back‐
        # slash  escape sequences is available.  Use the \1 and \2
        # escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing char‐
        # acters,  which  can  be used to embed a terminal control
        # sequence into the mode string.
set keyseq-timeout 500
#      Specifies  the duration readline will wait for a charac‐
#      ter when reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can
#      form  a  complete  key  sequence using the input read so
#      far, or can take additional input to complete  a  longer
#      key sequence).  If no input is received within the time‐
#      out, readline will use  the  shorter  but  complete  key
#      sequence.   The value is specified in milliseconds, so a
#      value of 1000 means that readline will wait  one  second
#      for  additional  input.   If  this  variable is set to a
#      value less than or equal to zero, or  to  a  non-numeric
#      value,  readline  will wait until another key is pressed
#      to decide which key sequence to complete.
set mark-directories On
#      If set to On, completed directory  names  have  a  slash
#      appended.
set mark-modified-lines On
#      If  set to On, history lines that have been modified are
#      displayed with a preceding asterisk (*).
set mark-symlinked-directories On
#      If set to On, completed names which are  symbolic  links
#      to  directories  have  a  slash appended (subject to the
#      value of mark-directories).
set match-hidden-files On
#      This variable, when set to On, causes readline to  match
#      files  whose  names begin with a `.' (hidden files) when
#      performing filename completion.   If  set  to  Off,  the
#      leading `.' must be supplied by the user in the filename
#      to be completed.
set menu-complete-display-prefix On
#      If set to On, menu completion displays the common prefix
#      of the list of possible completions (which may be empty)
#      before cycling through the list.
set output-meta On
#      If set to On, readline will display characters with  the
#      eighth  bit  set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed
#      escape sequence.
set page-completions Off
#      If set to On, readline uses an internal more-like  pager
#      to  display  a  screenful  of  possible completions at a
#      time.
set print-completions-horizontally Off
#      If set to On, readline  will  display  completions  with
#      matches   sorted  horizontally  in  alphabetical  order,
#      rather than down the screen.
set revert-all-at-newline Off
#      If set to On, readline will undo all changes to  history
#      lines before returning when accept-line is executed.  By
#      default, history lines may be modified and retain  indi‐
#      vidual undo lists across calls to readline.
set show-all-if-ambiguous On
#      This alters the default behavior of the completion func‐
#      tions.  If set to On, words which  have  more  than  one
#      possible completion cause the matches to be listed imme‐
#      diately instead of ringing the bell.
set show-all-if-unmodified On
#      This alters the default behavior of the completion func‐
#      tions in a fashion similar to show-all-if-ambiguous.  If
#      set to On, words which have more than one possible  com‐
#      pletion  without  any  possible  partial completion (the
#      possible completions don't share a common prefix)  cause
#      the  matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing
#      the bell.
set show-mode-in-prompt On
#      If set to On, add a character to the  beginning  of  the
#      prompt  indicating  the editing mode: emacs (@), vi com‐
#      mand (:) or vi insertion (+).
set skip-completed-text On
#      If set to On, this alters the default completion  behav‐
#      ior  when  inserting a single match into the line.  It's
#      only active when performing completion in the middle  of
#      a word.  If enabled, readline does not insert characters
#      from the completion that match characters after point in
#      the  word  being completed, so portions of the word fol‐
#      lowing the cursor are not duplicated.
#vi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))
#         This  string  is  displayed  immediately before the last
#         line of the primary  prompt  when  vi  editing  mode  is
#         active  and in command mode.  The value is expanded like
#         a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and  control
#         prefixes  and  backslash  escape sequences is available.
#         Use the \1 and \2 escapes to begin and end sequences  of
#         non-printing  characters,  which  can be used to embed a
#         terminal control sequence into the mode string.
#vi-ins-mode-string ((ins))
#         This string is displayed  immediately  before  the  last
#         line  of  the  primary  prompt  when  vi editing mode is
#         active and in insertion mode.   The  value  is  expanded
#         like  a  key  binding,  so the standard set of meta- and
#         control  prefixes  and  backslash  escape  sequences  is
#         available.   Use  the \1 and \2 escapes to begin and end
#         sequences of non-printing characters, which can be  used
#         to  embed  a  terminal  control  sequence  into the mode
#         string.
set visible-stats On
#      If set to On, a character  denoting  a  file's  type  as
#      reported  by  stat(2)  is  appended to the filename when
#      listing possible completions.
